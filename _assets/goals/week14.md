- Project
   - Characterize performance of class project
   - Characterize performance as a function of problem size
   - Characterize performance as a function of number of processors (both strong and weak scaling)
   - Predict how much performance could be improved with further optimization/parallelization
   - Make code easy for others to reuse
   - Make benchmarks easy to reproduce (for their own system)
   - Complete/clean-up project documentation and packaging
