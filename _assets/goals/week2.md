- Priorities for Scientific Computing
- Exercise 1:  Benchmarking
   + Benchmark functions accurately
   + Predict cost of an algorithm based on Big-O analysis
   + Identify real world complications that affect scaling
- Exercise 2: Assertions, Unit Tests & Continuous Integration Testing
   + Write effective tests for floating point calculations
   + Reduce bugs via _assertions_
   + Identify bugs promptly via _unit testing_
   + Identify bugs promptly via _continuous integration testing_
   + End-to-end Testing to validate code
- Exercise 3:  Numerical Stability of N-body Integration
   + Integrate differential equations
   + Compare the accuracy and numerical stability of results as a function of time step, order and integration algorithm
   + Appreciate importance of numerical stability
