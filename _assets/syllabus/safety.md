## Safety
While attendance and participation in class is important to the class and your learning, it is more important that we all stay safe and healthy.  
All students must follow all safety protocols (e.g., COVID) required or recommended by the university.  
University policies and recommendations may change during the semester.  
As of the start of class, current CDC and university guidance is to wear a facemask for 10 days after a known COVID exposure.   
The most up-to-date information can be accessed at [https://virusinfo.psu.edu/university-status/](https://virusinfo.psu.edu/university-status/).

If you have reason to beleive that you have been exposed to an infectous disease (e.g., COVID), you should either self-isolate or wear a well-fitting high-quality mask (e.g., N95, KN95, KF94) while in Davey Lab.  If you choose to self-isolate, then you can still earn full credit for reading questions and class participation by submitting reading questions prior to class and submitting lab and project assignments.  
Students should make plans to get a classmateâ€™s notes for any missed class sessions.  
Some of the class sessions may be moved online, based on community conditions or if the instructor needs to quarantine or isolate.
