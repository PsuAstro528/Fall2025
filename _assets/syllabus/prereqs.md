## Course Prerequisites
This course is designed for Astronomy & Astrophysics graduate students.  While Astro 501 is listed as a corerequsite by the registrar, that is primarily a formality, so that non-Astrophysics students will contact me to discuss their background before registering.  Previously, we have had some graduate students from physics and engineering who did very well in the course.  Of course, some extra thought may be required to figure out how concepts from the course presented in the context of astronomy or astrophysics could be applied to their own field of study.

Entering Astronomy & Astrophysics graduate students span a wide range in terms of level of experience with programming.  The goal is for all students to improve their understanding of computing, software development skills and programming patterns, regardless of whether they enter as a novice or experienced programmer.  Students entering with significant computing skills should aim to achieve more than students entering with minimal experience.  Astronomy graduate students who are not already familiar with using the Unix/Linux/OS X command line interface and/or with no programming experience are encouraged to take the course, but should be prepared to put in some extra effort early in the semester.  If you let me know about your background, I can suggest some resources to help you get started and/or schedule a time to meet with you to answer questions.
