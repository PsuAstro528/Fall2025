## Course Goals 
Successful students in the class will:
- Improve their skills in scientific computing and software development, 
- Develop software develoment programming practices that support efficient use of resources and reproducible results,
- Develop capacity to pefofrm high-performance and/or high-throughput scientific computing with an eye towards scaling up to larger problems and [Big Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data), and 
- Appreciate how established software development practices and parallel computing can benefit astronomy & astrophysics research.  

## Learning Objectives
Successful students in the class will:
-  Apply common programming patterns to analyze astronomical data or model astrophysical phenomena.  
-  Develop a basic understanding of modern computer architectures, memory systems and programming languages.
-  Organize code into modular functions and provide associated documentation and tests.
-  Apply established programming practices (e.g., version control, coding standards, unit testing)
-  Perform a code review and refactor code based on feedback from peer code review.  
-  Benchmark and profile a scientific code to identify performance-critical portions of a code and to identify sources of inefficiency.
-  Parallelize code for shared-memory, distributed-memory and accelerator architectures.
-  Identify lessons learned and communicate those to their peers. 

All of these objectives may not be realized within the one-semester course, and we will adapt the scope and emphasis based on student interests and programming experience.
