### Ending your Lynx Session

When you're all done with a lab (or just done for now):
- Save all changes to notebooks (Ctrl+S)
- Commit any changes to your repository, consider pushing those commits to GitHub.
- Close browser tabs for your Pluto session and the Jupyter tab.  
- Go back to the "My Interactive Sessions" tab in the Lynx Portal, click "Delete" for this session and confirm.
