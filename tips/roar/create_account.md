### Creating an Account on Roar Collab
(also known as ICDS-ACI)

\\

All students should [request an ACI account](https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/account-setup/) before the end of the __first day of class__.  
On the account request form,

- specify ebf11 as the sponsor account,
- select "Roar Collab" under Linux Clusers (probably on right),
- write "ebf11 Astro-528  {{semester}} course" into the Research Description box, and 
- leave Computational and Data Requirements box blank (since they already know what will be required for the class.)  

Students who already have an ACI account should contact Justin Petucci (jmp579@psu.edu) to request that they add your account to the Astro 528 group.

The next step is to [roar a setup script](../initial_setup)
