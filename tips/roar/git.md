### Setup Git

For students using Lynx for the first time, run commands **like** the following from the terminal on Lynx.
(If you're not already at a terminal, see [previous step](../initial_setup/).)
```shell
git config --global user.email "nobody@nowhere.org"
git config --global user.name "Your Github Id"
```
You only need to do this once at the beginning of the semester.  

Some students may wish to use their actual name and email.  
Other students may prefer to use github id rather than your real name, and a non-email address like nobody@nowhere.org to protect their privacy.
Either is fine.

\\

Don't exit the terminal now, as you'll continue running commands on the terminal in the next step.  
Now you're ready to [add your Lynx ssh keys to GitHub](../sshkeys).
