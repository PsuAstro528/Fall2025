## Finding a terminal on Lynx
There are three good options.
1. ssh to feed.lynx.hpc.psu.edu  
2. Open [portal.lynx.hpc.psu.edu](https://portal.lynx.hpc.psu.edu/) in your browser's guest or incognito mode.
  - Log in with your Penn State credentials (and authenticate if necessary).
  - Select Clusters > Shell Access (You'll likely have to complete 2 factor authentication again.)
3. Open [portal.lynx.hpc.psu.edu](https://portal.lynx.hpc.psu.edu/) in your browser's guest or incognito mode.
  - Log in with your Penn State credentials (and authenticate if necessary).
  - Request a Jupyter Lab session via the [Lynx portal](https://portal.lynx.hpc.psu.edu/) (see [starting Jupyter Lab & Pluto Servers](../../roar/jupyterlab/))
- Click _Click to Connect to Jupyter_ button. Click it.
- Go to the newly opened tab, you'll have a Jupyter Lab Server or a Pluto Server.
- If you don't see tiles for Python, Julia and Pluto Notebooks, then click _File.NewLauncher_.
- Find the _Terminal_ tile or in the menu system, _File.New.Terminal_.
