# Syllabus
Astro 528: High-Performance Scientific Computing for Astrophysics ({{semester}})

### Basic Info
\textinput{syllabus/basic_info}

### Scope & Sprit of the Course
_High-Performance Scientific Computing for Astrophysics_ will combine class discussion and programming exercises to train students in the use of modern computing hardware and programming strategies for application to astronomy and astrophysics research.  Students will gain experience applying these practices during a class project (potentially in support of the studentâ€™s dissertation research).  While Astro 528 is primarily intended for graduate students in the astronomy & astrophysics program, it is likely also beneficial for graduate students in other physical sciences and engineering.

This course can count toward the Penn State [Graduate Minor in Computational Science](https://bulletins.psu.edu/graduate/programs/minors/computational-science-graduate-minor/#text).  It is complementary to [Phys/Astro 587 _Computational Physics/Astrophysics_](https://bulletins.psu.edu/search/?scontext=courses&search=Astro+527&caturl=%2Fgraduate), the recent [Astro 585: _Astrostatistics_](https://bulletins.psu.edu/search/?scontext=courses&search=Astro+585&caturl=%2Fgraduate) and [Stat/IST 557: _Data Mining_](https://bulletins.psu.edu/search/?scontext=courses&search=Stat+557&caturl=%2Fgraduate).  The combination of these four courses with the domain expertise from their Ph.D. program would provide students with an excellent introduction to [Data Science](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws.drewconway.com/viz/venn_diagram/data_science.html).
