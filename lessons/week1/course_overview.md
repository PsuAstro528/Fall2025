# Course Overview

## Welcome
Penn State Astro 528
High-Performance Scientific Computing for Astrophysics
Eric Ford

## Course goals

Enhance your skills for scientific computing
- Increase your productivity
   + Choose right tool for right task
   + Reduce time debugging
   + Improve reproducibility
- Help you to write more efficient code, so you can:
   + Build intuition more rapidly
   + Analyze larger datasets ("Big Data")
   + Increase resolution of simulations
   + Include more complex physics
   + Perform more analyses/simualtions to explore sensitivity to parameters/assumptions
   + Increase impact of your software

## Course outline

- Software Development Practices
- Writing efficient serial code
- Parallelizing code efficiently

### Writing efficient serial code
- Processor architectures
- Memory hierarchy
- Networking
- Programming languages
- Choosing algorithms
- Benchmarking
- Profiling
- Compiler optimizations
- Optimizing
---

### Parallelizing code efficiently
- Shared-memory (e.g., one workstation)
- Distributed-memory (e.g., cluster)
- Accelerators
   + GPUs
   + TPUs (volunteers?)
- Cloud

\note{Ask if any students already using parallel codes.  If so, how were they parallelized?}

---
### Specific Objectives

- Increase technical knowledge
    + Readings, online lessons & class discussion
- Practice fundamentals on a small scale
    + Lab/homework exercises
    + Make lots of mistakes quickly & learn from them
    + Make good habits routine
- Transfer skills into real work environment
    + Class project
    + Apply new skills to your research
    + Build deeper expertise in topics most relevant to you
    + Share what you learn with the class
---

### Readings, presentation
- Textbooks
   + _Writing Scientific Software: A Guide to Good Style_
   + _ThinkJulia: How to Think like a Computer Scientist_
   + _Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers_ (definitely optional)
- Online PDFs
- Online tutorials
- Recordings (will try, no guaranty)

## Safety 
- Students are welcome/encouraged to wear masks, but are not required to mask at this time.  (Policy may change based on government/university guidance.)
- Please err on the side of caution:
  - If not feeling well, please stay home.  (You can still earn full credit.)
  - If have reason to believe may have been exposed recently, please stay home or at least wear a high-quality, well-fitting mask.
  - If engage in risky activities outside of class, please consider taking precautions to mitigate risk.
- I'll be wearing a mask in class.  
- I'll send announcement via Canvas if any classes need to move online 

----
### Class discussions
- Let's learn from each other
- Introductions
   + Name (& pronouns if you like)
   + Department (if not Astro)
   + Year of your program
   + What skill you hope to strengthen through this course
